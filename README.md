# Team Summary - Unit 10 OOP Homework

> You build the team. We'll build the index.

This homework dealt with using OOP-style modules in JS, specifically with ES6 classes and class inheritance.

## User Story

```
AS A team leader
I WANT an index of my teammates and how to contact them
SO THAT I'll be able to manage them more effectively
```

```
GIVEN THAT I have my team's data
WHEN I launch this app
THEN I want to be presented with a series of prompts that will populate a combined HTML page
WHEN I enter data for a user
THEN I want to be asked questions appropriate to their role
WHEN I finish entering data for one user
THEN I want to be able to transition into the next without any fuss.
```
